Project 1 - Ray Tracing 

This README file outlines the usage of the ray tracing program. 

Inital raytrace.c provided 

USAGE: Create an executalbe program using the make file. The executable raytrace takes in an input text file argument, and a generated *.ppm file is created in the same directory.
		Note: If an executable raytrace is already created it might be a good idea to do 'make clean' before the other command steps 
Command Steps: 1. make 
			   2. ./raytrace input[#].txt 
			   3. gimp output[#].ppm 

EXAMPLE: ./raytrace input1.txt 


OUTPUT FILE: The output file will use the given input name as part of the output name :
		output_input1.ppm 
TO VIEW IMAGE: Use a graphical image viewer that opens *.ppm type files to view the image. 

MAN HOURS: This project took roughly 7 hrs to complete.
